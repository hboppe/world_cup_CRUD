# World Cup

This is an API built with Django for managing national teams participating in the World Cup. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete team entries. For each team, you can specify the year of their first World Cup appearance. The API includes validation checks to ensure that the first World Cup year is valid and that the number of titles won by the team is consistent with the number of years they have been participating in the tournament.
